Use at your own risk. What QuickZip Is QuickZip is a CLI utility I developed to solve a backup problem on my machines. I wanted a way to quickly backup up small sets of configuration files and data without deploying a massive, hard to maintain tool with too much front-end configuration. QuickZip uses a config.toml file to build tiny list of backups that are conducted when called (typically via cron). Key Features Create jobs with configuration file, including support for variables and defaults Beautiful CLI Backup Audits Webhook Support $ qz --help Usage: qz [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

What QuickZip Isn't QuickZip is NOT a replacement for a robust backup or imaging software. It's primary use case is to collect configuration files on system other similar types of files, zip them up, and stick them somewhere else on your file system. Why not x ??? I can't comment on every backup utility but I can mention the few that I looked at. Borg was a strong contender and I will likely use it for other things down the line, however I felt like there was too much upfront configuration before being able to use. Rsync / Rclone were both great options but I felt there were too confusing/robust for what I was trying to do. On top of that, I was looking for a few features that I hadn't seen.
